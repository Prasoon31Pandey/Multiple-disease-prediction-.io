Multiple Disease Prediction Streamlit App

This Multiple Disease Prediction Streamlit App is an AI-powered web application designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on user input. Built using Python, Streamlit, and Machine Learning, this app provides an intuitive interface for quick and accurate health assessments.

Features
Predicts multiple diseases such as:
Diabetes
Heart Disease
Parkinson's Disease
User-friendly interface with form inputs for health parameters.
Real-time predictions based on trained machine learning models.
Secure handling of user inputs and privacy.

Technology Stack
Frontend: Streamlit
Backend: Python
Machine Learning: Trained models using libraries like:
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Deployment: Compatible with local or cloud deployment (e.g., Streamlit Cloud, Heroku).
How It Works
Input Health Parameters:

Enter values such as glucose level, blood pressure, age, etc., into the provided fields.
Click Predict:

The app processes the inputs and runs them through pre-trained machine learning models.
Get Results:

The app displays the prediction results, e.g., whether the user is at risk for a specific disease.
